This is my resume (created Dec 2020).

Looking around at resume templates, I came to the conclusion that the easy-to-use templates didn't look that great.
And the nice looking ones were not straightforward, or required learning a lot about the template.

Also, given that we're all in lockdown, what better way to spend some time than to play with tikz!

I tried to write this resume in a way that balances portability (for people to use) with not spending forever.

I hope this at least gives you a solid leg up in creating your own resume.
If you decide to rewrite this whole thing in a much more beautiful and extensible way, don't hesitate to drop me a line!
